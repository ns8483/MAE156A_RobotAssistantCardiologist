<h2>Project Background:

<h6>Transesophageal Echocardiography (TEE): ultrasound imaging technique for the heart. It is used to analyze heart defects and guides repair of valves. This procedure is conducted from inside the food pipe (esophagus) via a catheter.

<h2>Problem Definition Overview:

<h6>The current manual procedure is time Consuming (2 hours long), ergonomically challenging, has limited precision, and extensive exposure to harmful x-ray radiation from fluoroscopy.
<br><h4>**Our goal: Remotely operate procedure after initial manual catheter insertion.**</b>
